2. **Select Building by ID:** Return the CityGML Building matching the ID "VILLEURBANNE_00012_23" and its immediate properties

This button can toggle whether the text area for the query to be submitted is shown or not. This also allows the query to be edited before submission.

Queries are written in [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/)
